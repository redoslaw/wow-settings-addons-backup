v7.1.0.161026


--------------------

Vladinator89:
	- - TOC bump.
	- - Fixed chat detection since the changes in 7.1.
	- - Added an option to print default messages during raid groups. This is for those that prefer the full loot printout during raids, as they are a bit easier to read and find as the boss dies.
	- Added currency max count so it's printed as long the option to show items in bags is selected.
	- Fixed an issue with printing 0 XP gained on followers that are maxed out.
