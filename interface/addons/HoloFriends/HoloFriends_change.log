Change Log:
0.492: (by Andymon)
    * With LibWho-2.0 execute a new who request only if no other who request is active to limit who-spam
      if an addon is not accounting for LibWho-2.0 events
      (LibWho-2.0 is globaly disabling the regular in-game who event)
    * Skip class scan with who for realID friends to have less who requests
    * Ignore every who-request for realID friends if the client is not WoW
    * Limit the number of silent who requests by scanning the online state with SendAddonMessage
    * Hide system messages for silent requests now in all chat frames
    * Added clear comment to the option which disables all who requests of HoloFriends

      -> old realID friends list entries marked inactive (offline) can be deleted
      (see the not checked check box in front of realID friends in the HoloFriends friends list)
