------------------- BID/ROLL MANAGER --------------------

-- QDKP bid manager has been developed with flexibility in mind. This means that it can be tricky to set up, depending on your
-- guild needs. The bid manager will listen for a list of possible keywords in raid and wispers. When found, the player who
-- wrote that word will be added to the "Bid manager" list in the players roster.
-- The "Value" field is a custom value that can get several meanings. The mostcommon, it will just be the player's DKP bid amount.
-- You can configure QDKP to perform some further calculation using several variables. You can read some example in hereunder.
-- The following configuration is a basic template that will work on most of the cases.
-- Keywords that QDKP will listen to by default: "need", "greed", "bid", "all", "half", "min" and /roll.
-- If you have troubles adapting the bid manager to your guild's rules, feel free to to post in the new website forums. 
-- http://www.quickdkp.com
-- I'll try to set up the keywords for you.
--
-- ALL keywords are CaSe InSeNsItIvE

QDKP2_BidM_Keywords={
{keywords="need,greed"},			--basic keywords to be used in a loot council guild (no bids).
{keywords="$n,bid $n,need $n"},			--$n stands for any valid numeric value. this will catch bids.
{keywords="half", value="$net/2"}, 		--The "value" keyword is used to tell QDKP how to calculate the "Value" field.
{keywords="all,max,all in",value="$net"}, 	--this is just the complementary of the previous keyword.
{keywords="min,minimum",value="$minbid"}, 	--this places the minimum bid. if your guild doesn't have a minimum bid, simply remove it
{keywords="/roll", value="$net", dkp="$net/2"},
{keywords="os", value="$roll*-1", dkp="0"},



-- the following keywords are only examples to show what you can do with the parameters:

-- This keyword introduces the "dkp" parameter, used to set the amount to charge the winner for if differs from the bid value.
-- In this example, I calculate the bid value as percentage of the bet versus the net DKP amount
-- When the winner will be announced, though, the charged DKP will be the orginal bid.
-- {keywords="$n, bid $n, need $n", value="$n*100/$net", dkp="$n"},

-- The $mintowin parameter should be used if your guild follow the "second highest bid+1", which means that the winner
-- does not spend all the bet amount, but rather the amount bet by the second bidder plus one dkp.
-- Example: PlayerA bets 50 dkp, playerB bets 30. PlayerA wins and pays 31 DKP.
-- Should there is only one bidder, he will pay the minimum bid amount.
-- {keywords="$n, bid $n, need $n", dkp = "$mintowin"},

-- You can use the "min" and "max" parameters to change the minimum/maximum bet a player can place. This can be used to
-- set up a fixed-step bid system where a player must increase the previous bet by a minimum amount (in this case, 5).
-- the variable $higherbid1 is replaced by the actual top bet.
-- {keywords="$n, bid $n, need $n", min="($higherbid1 or $minbid)+5"},
-- {keywords="bid", value="($higherbid1 or $minbid)+5"}, --this is to automatically place a highest+5 bid when someone whispers you "bid"

-- This keyword is an implementation of a random influenced loot system. The player's bid will be modified by a coefficent that is 1 if
-- the roll is 0 and tops 3 if the roll is 100.
-- {keywords="$n,bid $n,need $n" ,value="(1+$roll*2/100)*$n", dkp="$n"},

-- The "/roll" keyword is triggered when someone rolls. It can be used to react to /rolls, for example placing a  bid or blocking it.
-- in this example, we get the bid value adding the net DKP amount to the 1-100 roll. the winner is charged by half his DKP.
-- {keywords="/roll", value="$net+$roll", dkp="$net/2"}

-- These keywords are an implementation of the Ni Karma-like bidding system, where a player can use his DKP to place a "karma" (improved)
-- roll for half of their DKP (if they have at least 50 dkp), a normal "need" roll for 5 dkp, or an offspec roll for free.
-- offspec values will be reported as negative numbers, so that the bidder with the highest value is the winner in any case.
-- It also show how to tell QDKP if a player is eligible to use a keyword with the "eligible" field.
-- Credits for this system go to Ashley Francois (Zafrina of Kul Tiras).
-- {keywords="karma,bonus", value="$roll+$net", dkp="$net/2", min="50"},
-- {keywords="need,no bonus", value="$roll", dkp="5"}, --this keyword is not needed in a pure ni karma system, but can be useful.
-- {keywords="offspec", value="$roll-101", dkp="0"},

-- The $itemprice keyword is used to  bridge the bid manager with the fixed price system. You can, for example, set up prices and then
-- use them as minimum bid values, letting the players bid for more if they want:
-- {keywords="greed,offspec,/roll", value="$itemprice or $minbid"},
-- {keywords="$n, bid $n, need $n", min="$itemprice or $minbid"},

-- There are a lot of parameters that can be used in a keyword. In this example, everyone can bid for items with iLevel lower or equal to 250, but
-- higher level items may be only rolled by players whose rank is lesser than 3 and are not alts (please note that rank number is 1 for guild master
-- and then increases as the ranks get lower).
-- {keywords="$n, bid $n, need $n", eligible="($itemlevel or 0)<=250"},
-- {keywords="/roll",eligible="(($itemlevel or 0) <=250) or ($rank<=3 and not $isalt)"},
