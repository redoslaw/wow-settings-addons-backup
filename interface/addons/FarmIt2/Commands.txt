size {#} {#}

  Set the total number of buttons available on a given bar. There is a limit of 48 buttons per bar.
  For example: '/farmit size 1 10' would configure bar number one to have ten total buttons available on it. 
  Setting a bar to a smaller size will permanently delete any extra buttons.
  To simply hide some button spaces on a bar without destroying them, 
  click on the 'quick size' buttons (+/-) on the bar anchor.


grow {#} {L|R|U|D}

  For example: '/farmit grow 1 R' sets bar #1 to horizontal mode, growing to the right.


style {default|minimal}

  Choose a visual style (requires UI reload):
    'default' is meant to match the stock WoW interface.

  Only use this if you are having problems with saved data like templates, etc. 
  WARNING: This will wipe out all your bars, preferences, and saved templates!
